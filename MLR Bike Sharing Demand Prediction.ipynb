The company wants to know:\n","\n","•\tWhich variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.\n","\n","•\tHow well those variables describe the bike demands\n","\n","You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Importing the necessary libraries "]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":813,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2021-12-15T08:53:02.878970Z","iopub.status.busy":"2021-12-15T08:53:02.878691Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-12-15T08:53:02.889684Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-12-15T08:53:02.888993Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-12-15T08:53:02.878939Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","%matplotlib inline\n","\n","import statsmodels.api as sm\n","from statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence import variance_inflation_factor\n","\n","import sklearn\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n","from sklearn.feature_selection import RFE\n","from sklearn.metrics import r2_score\n","import warnings\n","warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n","\n","\n","pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)\n","pd.set_option('display.max_rows', None)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Step 1 - Reading and Exploring the dataset\n","Performing basic operations to get uber level understanding of the dataset\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":815,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2021-12-15T08:53:02.912859Z","iopub.status.busy":"2021-12-15T08:53:02.912647Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-12-15T08:53:02.928774Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-12-15T08:53:02.927881Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-12-15T08:53:02.912833Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["bike_df = pd.read_csv(\"../input/dataset/day.csv\")\n","bike_df.head()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":816,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2021-12-15T08:53:02.930589Z","iopub.status.busy":"2021-12-15T08:53:02.930102Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-12-15T08:53:02.940455Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-12-15T08:53:02.939696Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-12-15T08:53:02.930503Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# The dataset has 730 rows and 16 columns \n","bike_df.shape"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":817,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2021-12-15T08:53:02.942740Z","iopub.status.busy":"2021-12-15T08:53:02.941911Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-12-15T08:53:02.957293Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-12-15T08:53:02.956432Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-12-15T08:53:02.942709Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# Looking at the unique number of values in each column\n","bike_df.nunique() "]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":818,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2021-12-15T08:53:02.958914Z","iopub.status.busy":"2021-12-15T08:53:02.958621Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-12-15T08:53:02.968160Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-12-15T08:53:02.967343Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-12-15T08:53:02.958869Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["bike_df.dtypes"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":819,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2021-12-15T08:53:02.969822Z","iopub.status.busy":"2021-12-15T08:53:02.969432Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-12-15T08:53:03.029628Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-12-15T08:53:03.028786Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-12-15T08:53:02.969794Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["bike_df.describe()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Substituting the values of the columns in some of the categorical variable with appropriate tags as mentioned in the data dictionary for better interpretability \n","Some of the columns which are having only binary values such as 0 and 1 will not be altered because therequirement is already satisfied with the existing data type.
